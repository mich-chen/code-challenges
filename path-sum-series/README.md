# Code Challenge: Path Sum series

## Path Sum I
Given a binary tree and a sum, determine if the tree has a root-to-leaf path such that adding up all the values along the path equals the given sum.

Return True or False if there exist a root-to-leaf path which sums to given sum.

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,null,1] sum = 22
Output: True
```

## Path Sum II
Given a binary tree and a sum, find all root-to-leaf paths where each path's sum equals the given sum.

Return a 2d list of each path's values in a list. (ex: [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]])

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [5,4,8,11,null,13,4,7,2,null,null,5,1] sum = 22
Output: [
   [5,4,11,2],
   [5,8,4,5]
]
```
