## Code Challenge: Reverse a Doubly Linked list
Youâ€™re given the pointer to the head node of a doubly linked list. Reverse the order of the nodes in the list. The head node might be `None` to indicate that the list is empty. Change the next and prev pointers of all the nodes so that the direction of the list is reversed. Return a reference to the head node of the reversed list.

#### Example:
```
Input: 1 <-> 2 <-> 3 <-> 4 <-> None
Output: 4 <-> 3 <-> 2 <-> 1 <-> None
```
