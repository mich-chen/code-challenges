## Code Challenge: Minimum Absolute Difference in BST

Given a binary search tree with non-negative values, find the minimum absolute difference between values of any two nodes. Output is the difference between any two nodes (value may be negative).

#### Example 1:
```
Input: [1,null,3,2]
Output: 1
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: [5,3,7,1,2,6,null]
Output: -1
```

**Constraints:**
* There are at least two nodes in this BST.
* This question is the same as 783: https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-distance-between-bst-nodes/
