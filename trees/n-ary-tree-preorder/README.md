## Code Challenge: N-ary Tree Preorder Traversal
Given an n-ary tree, return the preorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

**Follow up**
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

#### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [1,3,5,6,2,4]
```
