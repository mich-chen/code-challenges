## Code Challenge: Fibonacci Number

The Fibonacci Numbers, commonly denoted `F(n)` form a sequence, called the **Fibonacci sequence**, suchthat each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, starting from `0` and `1`. 

```
F(0) = 0, F(1)
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2), for n > 1
```

Given `n`, calculate `F(n)

#### Example 1:
```
Input: n = 2
Output: 1
Explanation: F(2) = F(1) + F(0) = 1 + 0 = 1.
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: n = 4
Output: 3
Explanation: F(4) = F(3) + F(2) = 2 + 1 = 3.
```

**Constraints:** 
* 0 <= N <= 30
