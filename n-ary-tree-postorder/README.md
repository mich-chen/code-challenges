## Code Challenge: N-ary Tree Postorder Traversal
Given an n-ary tree, return the postorder traversal of its nodes' values.

Nary-Tree input serialization is represented in their level order traversal, each group of children is separated by the null value (See examples).

**Follow up:**
Recursive solution is trivial, could you do it iteratively?

#### Example 1:
```
Input: root = [1,null,3,2,4,null,5,6]
Output: [5,6,3,2,4,1]
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: root = [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
Output: [1,null,2,3,4,5,null,null,6,7,null,8,null,9,10,null,null,11,null,12,null,13,null,null,14]
```
