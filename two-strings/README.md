## Code Challenge: Two Strings
Given two strings, determine if they share a common substring. A substring may be as small as one character.

For example, the words "a", "and", "art" share the common substring `a`. The words "be" and "cat" do not share a substring.

It should return either `True` or `False` based on whether the strings share a common substring.

**Note:** `s1` and `s2` consist of characters in the range ascii[a-z]

#### Example 1:
```
Input: "hello", "world"
Output: True
Explanation: substrings 'o' and 'l'
```

#### Example 2:
```
Input: "hi", "world"
Output: False
```
